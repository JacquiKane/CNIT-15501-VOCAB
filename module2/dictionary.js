  "High Level Language, HLL":
    "Programming Language, <i>readable</i>, because contains words like <i>while, if, else</i>",
  "Low Level Language":
    "Language that is closer to the processor, like assembly language, machine language. <br>MOV 001, <br>10000001 11",

  "Primary Storage":
    "Computer Memory, RAM. This is volatile storage, clears when there is no electricity supply!",
  "Secondary Storage":
    "Permanent storage, like on disk - could be CD, flash drive, HDD, SSD, even floppy disc!",
  HDD: "Hard Disk Drive, older technology that stores data on spinning magnetic discs. Data can be erased if disc head crashes.",

    "Process of passing data to a computer application by some mechanism not limited to keyboard, touch sensitive screen, mouse, microphone.",
  Output:
    "Process of displaying or rendering results of computation - like display on a monitor or audio through speakers.",
  Interpreter:
    "Software that renders program code to machine language, statement by statement. Python is an interpreted language.",
  Compiler:
    "Software that renders all program code in a program,  to machine language at the one time. Typically results in an executable. C is a compiled language.",
  Comment:
    "Annotation that is ignored by compiler or interpreter, like single line comment, #, in Python.",
  "Camel Casing":
    "Naming convention - use lower case first letter, and upper case first letter for each subsequent word in name - like studentGradYear, productData.",
  "Snake Casing":
    "Naming convention, use all lower case, separating each logical word with an underscore, like student_grad_year, product_data.",
  "Pascal Casing":
    "Naming convention, use upper case first letter, and upper case first letter for all subsequent logocal words in anme, like StudentGradYear, ProductData.",
  "String Literal":
    'String that has not been assigned to a variable, but is used in program code, like print("Hi there"). In this case, the string "Hi there" would be a string literal.',
  Boolean:
    "Data type, value of True or False only. Extensively using in computer programming to detrmine branching and store results of Boolean Logic operations.",
  String:
    'Data type, uses text encased in quotes, like "Hi there". String data type is used to handle text data.',
  "float, Floating Point":
    "Data type, numeric, supports numbers after decimal point - like 1.23",
  "int, Integer": "Data type, supports whole numbers, no decimal point, like 5",
  "Reference diagram":
    "Diagram that illustrates variables and associated values",
  Variable: "Named location in computer memory",
  "Data Type":
    "Category of data that a quantity belongs to, like Integer, Boolean, String, Float",

    "Quantity stored in a variable, like<br>studentGPA = 3.8<br>... the data value of the variable, studentGPA, is 3.8",
  Function:
    "Block of code that is given a name by which to call it, like the special main function in Python.",
  IDE: "Integrated Development Environment, tool for creating , managing and executing code, like VS Code, Brackets, PyCharm.",
  GUI: "Graphical User Interface, user interface that includes visual elements like windows, buttons, menu bars.",
  Indentation:
    "Typically the use of a tab character, and used to indicate containment or code within the body of a block, like code indented within a function in Python",
  Indent: "Adding an indentation to a code block to indicate containment.",
  Dedent:
    "Removing an indentation from a code block to change the scope of the code, perhaps remove the code from a function.",
  Docstring:
    'Multi-line comment, """ .... """ at the top of a Python file, includes information like name of developer, date created',
  "Escape Sequences":
    'Special characters that are embedded in strings and are intertreted as new line, tabs, like print("This is a \\n Newline").',
  "Conversion Function":
    "Function that converts the data type of a variable, to another data type, like converting int variable, studentGradYear, to a String, with str(sudentGradYear).",
  "Strongly Typed":
    "Enforcement of strict rules for mixing data types and variables. Python is stronlly typed.",
  "Dynamically Typed":
    "Data type of variable is determined at runtime, after an assignment. Python is dynamically typed.",
